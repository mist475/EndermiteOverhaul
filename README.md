# Endermite Overhaul

Have you ever felt that endermites have wasted potential as a gameplay mechanic?
If so, so do I. This mod attempts to fix that by changing and expanding on endermite mechanics.

As 1.7.10 is the main version of the game I still play, for now it will be the primary target version for this mod.
If someone wants to port the mod to a different version of the game, please get in touch (see #Contributing)

# Dependencies
Requires [Et Futurum Requiem](https://github.com/Roadhog360/Et-Futurum-Requiem) and [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins) as a dependencies

Keep in mind Et Futurum Requiem might have dependencies on its own, so make sure to check this on the Et Futurum Requiem page.

## Features
- Endermite eggs spawn in patches underground, in the nether and in the end.

- These eggs hatch after a while, or after they're trampled. Revealing a variable amount of endermites
- Endermen are drawn towards these eggs and will protect them
- Endermen will aggro on anything that destroys the eggs
- Endermites have a chance to drop an egg on death (the chance increases up to 100% if the endermite is older than 10 minutes)

## Changes from vanilla endermite mechanics

- Endermen now protect endermites, rather than attack them
- (Optional) Disable vanilla endermen spawns, forcing the player to find endermite eggs in order to go to the end

## Configurability
- Enable endermite egg generation (if this is disabled you can only get eggs by killing endermites obtained the regular way)
- Use a whitelist or a blacklist to configure where endermite eggs should spawn
- Disable vanilla endermen spawns, forcing the player to find endermite eggs in order to go to the End
